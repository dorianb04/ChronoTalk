        "content": "Napoleon's family hailed from Italy. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, originated from a minor Tuscan noble family that migrated to Corsica in the 16th century. His maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a minor Genoese noble family. His parents, Carlo Maria Bonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino, maintained an ancestral home known as 'Casa Bonaparte' (now Maison Bonaparte) in Ajaccio. Napoleon, the fourth child and third son, was born there on 15 August 1769. He had an elder brother, Joseph, and younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme. Napoleon, baptized as Napoleone, also had variations in the spelling of his name during his youth: Nabulione, Nabulio, Napolionne, and Napulione. Napoleon was born a year after Corsica was ceded to France by the Republic of Genoa. The island was formally incorporated as a province in 1770, following 500 years under Genoese rule and 14 years of independence. Despite his parents' earlier involvement in the Corsican resistance against the French, they later aligned with the new French government. Napoleon's father, Carlo, previously a supporter of patriot Pasquale Paoli, later worked for the French government and became the island's representative at the court of Louis XVI in 1777. The dominant influence on Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline shaped the character of the rambunctious child. Napoleon later emphasized, 'The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother.' His maternal grandmother had a second marriage into the Swiss Fesch family, and Napoleon's uncle, Cardinal Joseph Fesch, played a protective role for the Bonaparte family for some years. Napoleon's noble background provided him with greater educational opportunities than the typical Corsican of his time. At the age of 9, Napoleon moved to the French mainland, enrolling in a religious school in Autun in January 1779. Later, he transferred to a military academy at Brienne-le-Château with a scholarship in May 1779. In his youth, Napoleon was a vocal Corsican nationalist, supporting the state's independence from France. He spoke and read Corsican and Italian but began learning French around the age of 10. Despite becoming fluent, he retained a distinctive Corsican accent and never mastered French spelling. This, along with his birthplace, short stature, and mannerisms, led to routine bullying by peers. Napoleon, however, became reserved and focused on reading, excelling in mathematics, history, and geography, earning praise for his potential as a sailor. A notable story from Napoleon's school days is that he led junior students to victory against seniors in a snowball fight, showcasing his leadership abilities. In early adulthood, Napoleon briefly considered becoming a writer, authoring a history of Corsica and a romantic novella. Upon completing his studies at Brienne in 1784, Napoleon entered the École Militaire in Paris. Despite financial constraints following his father's death, he trained to become an artillery officer and graduated in one year, becoming the first Corsican to do so. His examination was conducted by the renowned scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace."

        "content": "Upon graduating in September 1785, Bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in La Fère artillery regiment. He served in Valence and Auxonne until after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789. Bonaparte was a fervent Corsican nationalist during this period. He asked for leave to join his mentor Pasquale Paoli when Paoli was allowed to return to Corsica by the National Assembly. However, Paoli had no sympathy for Napoleon, as he deemed his father a traitor for having deserted the cause of Corsican independence. He spent the early years of the Revolution in Corsica, fighting in a complex three-way struggle among royalists, revolutionaries, and Corsican nationalists. Napoleon embraced the ideals of the Revolution, becoming a supporter of the Jacobins and joining the pro-French Corsican Republicans who opposed Paoli's policy and his aspirations to secede. He was given command over a battalion of volunteers and promoted to captain in the regular army in 1792, despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against French troops. When Corsica declared formal secession from France and requested the protection of the British government, Napoleon and his commitment to the French Revolution came into conflict with Paoli, who had decided to sabotage the Corsican contribution to the Expédition de Sardaigne by preventing a French assault on the Sardinian island La Maddalena. Bonaparte and his family were compelled to flee to Toulon on the French mainland in June 1793 because of the split with Paoli. Although he was born 'Napoleone Buonaparte,' it was after this that Napoleon began styling himself 'Napoléon Bonaparte.' His family did not drop the name Buonaparte until 1796. The first known record of him signing his name as Bonaparte was at the age of 27 (in 1796)."

        "content": "In July 1793, Bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet, Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire), which gained him the support of Augustin Robespierre, the younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre. Assisted by his fellow Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed senior gunner and artillery commander of the republican forces arriving at Toulon on 8 September. He devised a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city's harbor and force the British to evacuate. The assault on the position resulted in the capture of the city, and during it, Bonaparte was wounded in the thigh on 16 December. Noticing his military prowess, the Committee of Public Safety entrusted him with the artillery of France's Army of Italy. By 22 December, he was en route to a new post in Nice, earning promotion from colonel to brigadier general at the age of 24. He formulated plans to attack the Kingdom of Sardinia as part of France's campaign against the First Coalition. The French army executed Bonaparte's strategy in the Battle of Saorgio in April 1794, advancing to seize Ormea in the mountains. From Ormea, it moved west to outflank the Austro-Sardinian positions around Saorge. Following this successful campaign, Augustin Robespierre dispatched Bonaparte on a mission to the Republic of Genoa to assess the country's intentions towards France."

        "content": "Some contemporaries alleged that Bonaparte was put under house arrest at Nice for his association with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794. Bonaparte's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs, attributing it to jealousy between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy, with whom Bonaparte was seconded at the time. Bonaparte sent an impassioned defense in a letter to the commissar Saliceti and was acquitted of any wrongdoing. He was released within two weeks (on 20 August) and, due to his technical skills, was tasked with drawing up plans to attack Italian positions in the context of France's war with Austria. He also participated in an expedition to reclaim Corsica from the British, but the French were repulsed by the British Royal Navy. By 1795, Bonaparte had become engaged to Désirée Clary, daughter of François Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's brother Joseph. In April 1795, he was assigned to the Army of the West, involved in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west-central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general, and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting. He was transferred to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety, seeking unsuccessfully to be transferred to Constantinople to offer his services to the Sultan. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, drawing a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Clary. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for refusing to serve in the Vendée campaign, facing financial difficulties and reduced career prospects. On 3 October, royalists in Paris declared a rebellion against the National Convention. Paul Barras, a leader of the Thermidorian Reaction, appointed Bonaparte to command improvised forces in defense of the convention in the Tuileries Palace. Remembering the massacre of the King's Swiss Guard three years earlier, Bonaparte realized that artillery would be crucial to its defense. He ordered a young cavalry officer, Joachim Murat, to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on 5 October 1795—13 Vendémiaire An IV in the French Republican Calendar. The royalist insurrection was defeated, resulting in 1,400 royalists dead and the rest fleeing. This victory brought Bonaparte sudden fame, wealth, and the patronage of the new government, the Directory. Murat married one of Bonaparte's sisters and served as one of Bonaparte's generals. Bonaparte was promoted to Commander of the Interior and given command of the Army of Italy. Within weeks, he entered into a romantic relationship with Joséphine de Beauharnais, the former mistress of Barras, and the couple married on 9 March 1796 in a civil ceremony."

        "title": "First Italian Campaign and Rise to Power",
        "content": "Two days after his marriage, Bonaparte departed from Paris to assume command of the Army of Italy. Launching an immediate offensive, he aimed to defeat the Kingdom of Sardinia's forces before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a rapid series of victories during the Montenotte Campaign, he eliminated Piedmont from the war within two weeks. The French then turned their attention to the Austrians for the remainder of the conflict, with the protracted struggle for Mantua becoming a focal point. Despite Austrian offensives to break the siege, Bonaparte defeated every relief effort, achieving victories at Castiglione, Bassano, Arcole, and Rivoli. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy, with the Austrians losing up to 14,000 men compared to the French's approximately 5,000 casualties. The subsequent phase of the campaign saw the French invading the Habsburg heartlands. Although French forces in Southern Germany had suffered defeat in 1796, the Archduke Charles withdrew his forces to protect Vienna upon learning of Bonaparte's assault. In their first encounter, Bonaparte pushed Charles back and penetrated deep into Austrian territory after winning the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797. Alarmed by the French thrust reaching Leoben, about 100 km from Vienna, the Austrians sought peace. The Treaty of Leoben, followed by the comprehensive Treaty of Campo Formio, granted France control of most of northern Italy and the Low Countries, with a secret clause promising the Republic of Venice to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice, securing its surrender and ending 1,100 years of Venetian independence. During this campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 standards, winning 18 pitched battles and 67 actions through superior artillery technology and tactical brilliance. Bonaparte's political influence in France grew during the campaign. He founded two newspapers—one for his army and one for circulation in France. Royalists criticized him for looting Italy, warning of a potential dictatorship. Bonaparte's forces seized an estimated $45 million in funds, along with $12 million in precious metals and jewels, and confiscated over 300 priceless paintings and sculptures. Bonaparte sent General Pierre Augereau to Paris for a coup d'état, purging the royalists on 4 September—the Coup of 18 Fructidor. Although Barras and his Republican allies regained control, they became dependent on Bonaparte, who initiated peace negotiations with Austria leading to the Treaty of Campo Formio. Bonaparte returned to Paris on 5 December 1797 as a hero and met with Talleyrand, France's new Foreign Minister, to prepare for the planned invasion of Britain."

        "title": "Egyptian Expedition and Conquests",
        "content": "After two months of planning, Bonaparte concluded that France's naval strength was insufficient to confront the British Royal Navy. Opting for a military expedition, he aimed to seize Egypt, disrupting Britain's access to trade interests in India. Bonaparte sought to establish a French presence in the Middle East and collaborate with Tipu Sultan, the Sultan of Mysore, an adversary of the British. He assured the Directory that, upon conquering Egypt, he would establish relations with Indian princes to collectively challenge English possessions. The Directory agreed, viewing it as a means to secure a trade route to the Indian subcontinent. In May 1798, Bonaparte was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. His Egyptian expedition included 167 scientists, contributing to significant discoveries such as the Rosetta Stone, with their findings published in the Description de l'Égypte in 1809. En route to Egypt, Bonaparte reached Malta on 9 June 1798, capturing the island from the Knights Hospitaller with minimal resistance. Evading pursuit by the Royal Navy, Bonaparte landed in Alexandria on 1 July. He engaged in the Battle of Shubra Khit against the Mamluks, Egypt's ruling military caste, refining defensive tactics for the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July. Despite facing a numerically similar force, the French emerged victorious, boosting morale. On 1 August 1798, the British fleet under Sir Horatio Nelson defeated most of the French fleet in the Battle of the Nile, hindering Bonaparte's reinforcement of the French position in the Mediterranean. Though his army achieved a temporary increase in French power in Egypt, it faced repeated uprisings. In early 1799, Bonaparte moved into the Ottoman province of Damascus, leading French forces in the conquest of coastal towns such as Arish, Gaza, Jaffa, and Haifa. The assault on Jaffa was marked by brutality, with Bonaparte ordering the execution of defenders and prisoners, resulting in robbery and murder for three days. Beginning with 13,000 men, Bonaparte's army suffered casualties from combat and disease, including the bubonic plague. Failing to capture the fortress of Acre, he retreated to Egypt in May. Allegedly ordering plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium to expedite the retreat, Bonaparte returned to Egypt on 25 July and defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir."

        "content": "While in Egypt, Bonaparte remained informed about European affairs and learned of France's defeats in the War of the Second Coalition. Fearing the Republic's uncertain future, on 24 August 1799, taking advantage of the temporary absence of British ships from French coastal ports, he set sail for France without explicit orders from Paris. The army was entrusted to Jean-Baptiste Kléber. Unbeknownst to Bonaparte, the Directory had issued orders for his return to defend against potential invasions, but communication issues prevented their delivery. When he reached Paris in October, France had experienced a series of victories, improving its situation. However, the Republic was financially strained, and the unpopular Directory lacked support among the French population. While the Directory debated Bonaparte's perceived desertion, it lacked the strength to take punitive action against him. Despite the setbacks in Egypt, Bonaparte returned to a hero's welcome. Forming an alliance with Talleyrand and members of the Council of Five Hundred—Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, his brother Lucien, Roger Ducos, and Joseph Fouché—they orchestrated a coup d'état on 9 November 1799 (the 18th Brumaire, revolutionary calendar). This event led to the dissolution of the Council of Five Hundred. Napoleon assumed the position of 'first consul' for ten years, appointing two consuls with consultative roles. His authority was solidified by the new 'Constitution of the Year VIII,' initially designed by Sieyès to limit Napoleon's influence but revised by Napoleon himself. The constitution, accepted through a direct popular vote (3,000,000 in favor, 1,567 opposed), maintained the semblance of a republic while establishing a de facto dictatorship."

        "title": "Consolidating Power: French Consulate and the War of the Second Coalition",
        "content": "Bonaparte established a political system that historian Martyn Lyons termed a 'dictatorship by plebiscite.' Concerned about the democratic forces unleashed by the Revolution but unwilling to disregard them entirely, Bonaparte engaged in regular electoral consultations with the French people on his path to imperial power. Drafting the Constitution of the Year VIII, he secured his own election as First Consul, taking up residence at the Tuileries. The constitution gained approval in a manipulated plebiscite held the following January, with an official result of 99.94 percent voting 'yes.' Napoleon's brother, Lucien, falsified the returns, claiming 3 million participants, whereas the actual number was 1.5 million. With an estimated 5 million eligible voters, the regime artificially doubled the participation rate to suggest widespread enthusiasm for the consulate. In the initial months, with ongoing European warfare and internal instability, Bonaparte's hold on power remained precarious. In the spring of 1800, Bonaparte and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula in his absence. After a challenging Alpine crossing, the French army entered Northern Italy largely unopposed. Facing an Austrian force in Genoa and another from the north, the French, under André Masséna, achieved a tactical advantage. The Battle of Marengo on 14 June initially favored the Austrians, but a timely arrival of a French division under Desaix turned the tide, resulting in a decisive victory. The Austrian army retreated, agreeing to the Convention of Alessandria the next day. Critics faulted Bonaparte for tactical errors but praised his audacity in selecting a risky campaign strategy. The victory at Marengo solidified Bonaparte's political authority and popularity, but peace did not immediately follow. Joseph Bonaparte led negotiations in Lunéville, reporting that Austria, emboldened by British support, refused to acknowledge France's new territory. As tensions escalated, Bonaparte ordered General Moreau to strike Austria again. Moreau's success at Hohenlinden in December 1800 compelled the Austrians to capitulate, signing the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801, which reaffirmed and expanded French gains from Campo Formio."

        "title": "Temporary Peace and Overseas Endeavors",
        "content": "After a decade of relentless conflict, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing an end to the Revolutionary Wars. The treaty mandated the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories and sought assurances to limit the expansionist ambitions of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte's popularity reached its zenith under the consulate, both domestically and internationally. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public overwhelmingly approved a constitution that established the Consulate as a permanent institution, effectively elevating Bonaparte to dictator for life. The referendum attracted 3.6 million voters (72 percent of eligible voters), a significant increase from the 1.5 million participants two years earlier. The constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote, granting Bonaparte broad powers, and officially proclaiming him First Consul for Life. The temporary peace in Europe allowed Napoleon to shift his focus to French colonies abroad, particularly Saint-Domingue, which had gained significant autonomy during the Revolutionary Wars. Napoleon sought to reestablish control over the colony, aiming to capitalize on its historical profitability. The abolition of slavery in 1794 had only affected specific colonies, and Napoleon, facing financial pressures, decided to reinstate slavery in all French Caribbean colonies. In Guadeloupe, where slavery had been abolished in 1794, a revolt broke out when slavery was reinstated in 1802. Napoleon dispatched an expedition under General Leclerc to assert control, but the French army faced challenges due to high disease rates, and the expedition ultimately failed. Dessalines, a leader in the resistance, proclaimed Haiti's independence in 1804. Concurrently, Napoleon, acknowledging the failure in Haiti, decided to sell the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803, doubling the size of the U.S. The peace with Britain proved uneasy and contentious. Britain did not evacuate Malta as promised and objected to Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. These disputes, not covered by Amiens, led to heightened tensions, culminating in Britain declaring war in May 1803. In response, Napoleon reassembled the invasion camp at Boulogne and issued a declaration that every British male between eighteen and sixty years old in France and its dependencies would be arrested as a prisoner of war."

        "content": "During the consulate, Napoleon faced various royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, such as the Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, a plot involving Moreau, ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, was uncovered. Acting on Talleyrand's advice, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating Baden's sovereignty. Despite not being involved in the plot, the Duke was swiftly executed after a secret military trial. Enghien's execution angered royal courts in Europe, contributing to the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. To consolidate his power and hinder a potential Bourbon restoration, Napoleon used these events to justify establishing an imperial system based on the Roman model. He argued that entrenching his family's succession in the constitution would make a Bourbon restoration more challenging. Through another referendum, Napoleon was elected Emperor of the French with overwhelming support, garnering nearly 99% of the vote. Similar to the Life Consulate two years earlier, the referendum drew significant participation, with almost 3.6 million voters. Observers noted that, exhausted by the turmoil of the Revolution, people sought the rule of a capable leader, genuinely believing that Bonaparte, whether as consul or emperor, would exert authority and save them from the perils of anarchy."

During the coronation, he raised a replica of Charlemagne's crown above his head in a symbolic gesture but did not wear it atop the wreath. The audience, spontaneously moved, rose to their feet, with men waving their hats. In a significant historical moment, Joséphine, Napoleon's wife, knelt before him to receive her crown, an event captured in the official painting by Jacques-Louis David. Joséphine became only the second queen in French history, after Marie de' Medici, to be crowned and anointed. Subsequently, Napoleon added to his titles by being crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. To secure the allegiance of the army at the official start of the Empire on 18 May 1804, Napoleon appointed eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals."

Napoleon, having realized the changing strategic situation, abandoned plans to invade England and turned his attention to the Rhine. In September 1805, he initiated the Ulm Campaign, employing an elaborate wheeling movement that outflanked Austrian positions. Austrian commander Karl Mack was surprised, leading to the Battle of Ulm, where Mack ultimately surrendered, and Napoleon captured 60,000 Austrian soldiers with minimal casualties. This strategic masterpiece, known as the Ulm Maneuver, significantly influenced military strategies like the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century. Simultaneously, at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, the Royal Navy secured a decisive victory, ensuring its dominance for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars. Following the Ulm Campaign, French forces captured Vienna in November and faced the Allies at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December. Napoleon feigned weakness, luring the Allies into attacking his right flank, while a forced march by Marshal Davout sealed the gap. The French executed a near-perfect plan, demolishing the Allied center and flanks, leading to the capture of thousands of prisoners. The Battle of Austerlitz, considered a tactical masterpiece, resulted in an armistice and the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December 1805. The treaty confirmed Austrian losses to France in Italy and Bavaria, as well as lands in Germany to Napoleon's allies. Napoleon remarked, 'The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought.'"

In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III recognized Napoleon as Emperor and forged an alliance with France, acknowledging France as the Ottoman Empire's 'sincere and natural ally.' This decision embroiled the Ottoman Empire in a losing war against Russia and Britain. Concurrently, Napoleon formed a Franco-Persian alliance with the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar. Unfortunately, this alliance collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia unexpectedly formed a pact. Despite his aspirations, Napoleon failed to establish effective alliances in the Middle East."

This collection of German states served as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, marking the demise of the Holy Roman Empire and alarming the Prussians. The audacious reorganization of German territory by the French provoked war fever in Berlin. Frederick William III, spurred on by his court, especially Queen Louise, decided to challenge French dominance by going to war.\nThe military manoeuvres commenced in September 1806, with Napoleon invading Prussia with 180,000 troops. Employing the 'bataillon-carré' system, Napoleon sought to destroy the Prussian army before reinforcements could arrive. The battles of Jena and Auerstedt on 14 October resulted in a decisive French victory, capturing 140,000 soldiers and crippling Prussian morale. Despite their defeat, the Prussians awaited Russian support before negotiating with the French.\nPost-victory, Napoleon imposed the Continental System through the Berlin Decree, prohibiting European trade with Britain. Napoleon then confronted the Russians in Poland, with the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 leading to a stalemate. The war resumed in June, with the Battle of Friedland on 14 June marking another overwhelming French triumph. Tsar Alexander sought peace, leading to peace negotiations at Tilsit in June 1807. The meeting between Napoleon and Alexander, characterized by initial cordiality, resulted in lenient terms for Russia, including joining the Continental System and ceding territories. Conversely, Prussia faced severe terms, losing half its territories to form the new kingdom of Westphalia. The Treaties of Tilsit granted Napoleon a respite from war, fostering a brief period of peace."

        "content": "Following the treaties at Tilsit, Napoleon turned his attention to enforcing the Continental System against British forces. His focus on Portugal, a consistent violator of trade prohibitions, led to the Peninsular War. In 1801, Portugal, after defeat in the War of the Oranges, adopted a double-sided policy. Unhappy with this change, Napoleon negotiated a secret treaty with Charles IV of Spain and sent an army under General Junot to invade Portugal in October 1807. This marked the beginning of the Peninsular War, a six-year struggle that drained French strength.\nDuring the winter of 1808, French agents became involved in Spanish internal affairs, leading to the announcement of Napoleon's intervention in February 1808. Marshal Murat led troops into Spain, and the French arrived in Madrid in March. Napoleon appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as the new King of Spain, provoking resistance. French defeats at the Battle of Bailén and the Battle of Vimiero encouraged Napoleon to intervene personally.\nBefore heading to Iberia, Napoleon addressed issues with Russia at the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808. The Erfurt Convention, an agreement between Napoleon and Tsar Alexander, called for Britain to cease hostilities, recognized Russian conquests, and affirmed Russian support in a potential war against Austria. Napoleon returned to France, crossed the Ebro River in November 1808, and inflicted defeats on the Spanish forces. After entering Madrid in December, he pursued the British forces under Moore.\nThe Peninsular War continued in Napoleon's absence, marked by brutal guerrilla warfare. The British, led by Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, arrived in the peninsula. Guerrilla fighting disrupted French supply lines, preventing them from concentrating their forces effectively. Despite maintaining around 300,000 troops in Iberia, the French couldn't turn the tide. The invasion of Russia in 1812 further weakened French presence in Spain. By 1814, the Allies had forced the French out of the peninsula. Napoleon's actions in Spain, including replacing the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, had a profound impact, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish American wars of independence."

The Austrian finance minister warned of running out of funds, pushing Austria toward war. On 8 February 1809, the Imperial Government decided to confront France.\nThe Austrian army crossed the Inn River on 10 April, surprising the French, and Napoleon hurriedly joined the Grande Armée at Donauwörth. Facing a perilous situation, Napoleon devised the Landshut Maneuver, repositioning his forces and winning the Battle of Eckmühl. Vienna fell again on 13 May, but the war persisted.\nThe Battle of Aspern-Essling marked Napoleon's first major defeat in a set-piece battle. After weeks of planning, the French crossed the Danube again in June–July for the Battle of Wagram, the largest battle of Napoleon's career. Despite heavy losses, the French emerged victorious, and an armistice was signed on 12 July.\nMeanwhile, the British launched the Walcheren Campaign to aid Austria, but it proved too late. The delayed political settlement led to the harsh Treaty of Schönbrunn in October 1809. Austria retained most hereditary lands, but France gained Carinthia, Carniola, Adriatic ports, and other territories. Austria lost over three million subjects. Post-war, Napoleon focused on domestic matters and, concerned about an heir, divorced Empress Joséphine and married Archduchess Marie Louise in 1810.

Despite early successes for Napoleon, the Battle of Leipzig marked a turning point. Napoleon faced a force twice his size and suffered a significant defeat, losing over 90,000 casualties. The Allies proposed peace terms in the Frankfurt proposals in November 1813, offering Napoleon control over reduced territories. Napoleon hesitated, expecting victory, and by December, the Allies withdrew the offer. In 1814, with his back against the wall, Napoleon tried to reopen negotiations but faced harsher terms, including a retreat to France's 1791 boundaries. Napoleon, reduced to 70,000 troops, resisted Allied forces entering France. The Coalition attacked Paris from the north and east. Joseph Bonaparte led a final battle but was defeated. Paris surrendered on 31 March 1814, and on 1 April, the Sénat conservateur passed the Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur, declaring Napoleon deposed. Napoleon proposed marching on Paris, but his senior officers mutinied, leading to his abdication in favor of his son on 4 April.

Located 10 km off the Tuscan coast, Elba was designated as his sovereign territory, allowing him to retain the title of Emperor. Prior to his exile, Napoleon attempted suicide with a pill he carried since his near-capture by the Russians during the Moscow retreat. The pill's potency had weakened, and he survived. His wife and son sought refuge in Austria. Transported to Elba on HMS Undaunted under Captain Thomas Ussher, Napoleon arrived at Portoferraio on May 30, 1814. During his initial months on Elba, Napoleon established a small navy and army, developed iron mines, built new roads, implemented decrees on modern agriculture, and reformed the island's legal and educational systems. A few months into exile, he learned about the death of his ex-wife Joséphine in France, causing profound distress and leading to his seclusion for two days."

        "content": "Separated from his wife and son, and cut off from the allowance guaranteed by the Treaty of Fontainebleau, Napoleon escaped from Elba on February 26, 1815, aboard the brig Inconstant with 700 men. Landing at Golfe-Juan two days later, he began heading north on the French mainland. The 5th Regiment intercepted him south of Grenoble on March 7, 1815. Approaching the regiment alone, Napoleon dismounted and, within gunshot range, shouted, 'Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish.' The soldiers responded with, 'Vive L'Empereur!' Ney, who had vowed to bring Napoleon to Paris in an iron cage, affectionately greeted his former emperor, and they marched together towards Paris, prompting the unpopular Louis XVIII to flee to Belgium. On March 13, the Congress of Vienna declared Napoleon an outlaw, and four days later, Britain, Russia, Austria, and Prussia pledged to field 150,000 men each to end his rule. Napoleon reached Paris on March 20, starting the Hundred Days period. By June, his armed forces reached 200,000, and he launched an offensive against the British and Prussian armies. The Battle of Waterloo on June 18 saw Napoleon's forces clash with Coalition armies, led by Wellington and Blücher. Wellington's army withstood attacks, and the Prussians broke through Napoleon's right flank. Returning to Paris, Napoleon found growing opposition, prompting his abdication on June 22 in favor of his son. He left Paris and settled in Malmaison. As Coalition forces advanced, Napoleon considered escape to the United States but surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland on HMS Bellerophon on July 15, 1815, after learning of Prussian troops' orders to capture him dead or alive."

        "title": "Exile on Saint Helena",
        "content": "Napoleon, held in British custody, was transferred to Saint Helena, an island in the Atlantic Ocean, 1,870 km (1,162 mi) from the west coast of Africa, aboard HMS Northumberland in October 1815. Guarded by a garrison of 2,100 soldiers and under constant patrol by a squadron of 10 ships, Napoleon and 27 followers arrived at Jamestown, Saint Helena. Despite rumors of escape plots, no serious attempts were made in the following years. After a brief stay at Briars pavilion, Napoleon was moved to Longwood House, a 40-room wooden bungalow. The house's location and interior were damp, windswept, rat-infested, and unhealthy. Napoleon often complained about his living conditions to the island's governor, Hudson Lowe, while attendants complained of poor provisions and health issues. Napoleon insisted on imperial formality, holding dinner parties with military dress and evening gowns. He received visitors, read, dictated memoirs, and studied English briefly. Reports of mistreatment circulated, prompting a parliamentary debate in March 1817. In mid-1817, Napoleon's health worsened, diagnosed with chronic hepatitis by his physician Barry O'Meara. Lowe dismissed O'Meara in July 1818, despite warnings about the poor climate and lack of exercise. In November 1818, the allies announced Napoleon's lifetime imprisonment on Saint Helena, leading to his increased depression and isolation. Some of his entourage left, and new arrivals, including two priests and physician Francesco Antommarchi, joined in September 1819."

        "title": "Death",
        "content": "Napoleon's health deteriorated, and in March 1821, he was confined to bed. In April, he wrote two wills alleging that he had been murdered by the British, predicting the fall of the Bourbons, and expressing the desire for his son to rule France. He bequeathed his fortune to 97 legatees and requested burial by the Seine. On 3 May 1821, he received the last rites but could not take communion due to illness. Napoleon passed away on 5 May 1821, at the age of 51. His final words, recorded differently by witnesses, included references to France, the army, his son, and Joséphine. Autopsy reports by Antommarchi and the British attributed his death to internal bleeding from stomach cancer, the disease that claimed his father. Despite theories of arsenic poisoning based on hair samples, a 2021 study by pathologists concluded that Napoleon died of stomach cancer. The original death mask, created on 7 May, was made by British surgeon Francis Burton with Antommarchi's assistance. Napoleon's heart and intestines were sealed in his coffin. Claims of souveniring Napoleon's body parts by Antommarchi are considered unlikely. Napoleon was buried with military honors in the Valley of the Geraniums, per his request if the British insisted on his burial on Saint Helena. In 1840, the British government permitted Louis Philippe I to return Napoleon's remains to France. The well-preserved body was exhumed and, after a state funeral in Paris, reinterred in a tomb designed by Louis Visconti at Les Invalides in 1861."
